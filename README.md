# dafuq?

The cli commands based API. **Dafuq?** are you thinking about deploying with this.

## Motivation
Ok, so you just discovered a really neat tool/library but... *oh, oh* its written in **THAT LANGUAGE**. All your dreams of api-fing that thing just blew up because you just wanted to run a little few commands here and there.

This recently happened at @Upplication, and **that language** happened to be ruby. It's not that we don't like ruby, it's just we dont have anyone on the team who can or have the time and motivation to start learning about it *properly*. So we decided to implement this kind of solution.

## TODO :(
